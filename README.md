# mentorship-vue3-rnm

This is a demo project for illustrating and showing different functionalities and how to write code with Vue. This is used in a series of short mentoring session with colleagues who are interested in the new Vue framework. The setup is through the new Vue 3 CLI and is set up with Vue 3 + TypeScript. Also for faster work and way to visualize our data we're using Element UI (v3 beta).
